      <description>&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. &amp;mdash; January 26, 2022 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Today, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, an organization established to provide publishers, creators, and consumers with opt-in, flexible ways to understand the authenticity and provenance across various media types, released version 1.0 of its technical specification for digital provenance. This specification is the first of its kind and empowers content creators and editors worldwide to create tamper-evident media, by enabling them to selectively disclose information about who created or changed digital content and how it was altered. The C2PA&amp;rsquo;s work is the result of industry-wide collaborations focused on digital media transparency that will accelerate progress toward global adoption of content provenance.</description>
