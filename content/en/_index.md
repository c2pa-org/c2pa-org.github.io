The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content. C2PA is a Joint Development Foundation project, formed through an alliance between Adobe, Arm, Intel, Microsoft and Truepic.

C2PA unifies the efforts of the Adobe-led [Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](https://contentauthenticity.org/) which focuses on systems to provide context and history for digital media, and [Project Origin](https://www.originproject.info/), a Microsoft- and BBC-led initiative that tackles disinformation in the digital news ecosystem.
