## Technology and media entities join forces to create standards group aimed at building trust in online content

*Adobe, Arm, BBC, Intel, Microsoft and Truepic\ form coalition to develop end-to-end, open standard for tracing the origin and evolution of digital content*

**SAN JOSE, Calif., and REDMOND, Wash. --- Feb. 22, 2021** 

A group of influential technology and media companies has partnered to form the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a [Joint Development Foundation project](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) established to address the prevalence of disinformation, misinformation and online content fraud through developing technical standards for certifying the source and history or provenance of media content. Founding members **Adobe, Arm, BBC, Intel, Microsoft** and **Truepic** seek to establish a standardized provenance solution with the goal of combating misleading content.

C2PA member organizations will work together to develop content provenance specifications for common asset types and formats to enable publishers, creators and consumers to trace the origin and evolution of a piece of media, including images, videos, audio and documents. These technical specifications will include defining what information is associated with each type of asset, how that information is presented and stored, and how evidence of tampering can be identified.

The C2PA's open standard will give platforms a method to preserve and read provenance-based digital content. Because an open standard can be adopted by any online platform, it is critical to scaling trust across the internet. In addition to the inclusion of varied media types at scale, C2PA is driving an end-to-end provenance experience from the capturing device to the information consumer. Collaboration with chipmakers, news organizations, and software and platform companies is critical to facilitate a comprehensive provenance standard and drive broad adoption across the content ecosystem.

The formation of the C2PA brings together founding members of the Adobe-led [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/) (CAI) and the Microsoft- and BBC-led [Project Origin](https://www.originproject.info/), unifying technical specifications under a single entity. The CAI is building a system to provide provenance and history for digital media, giving creators a tool to claim authorship and empowering consumers to evaluate whether what they are seeing is trustworthy. Project Origin has its roots in the production and distribution of news. The effort has focused on tackling disinformation in the digital news ecosystem by attaching signals to a piece of content to demonstrate its integrity and making this information available to those using it. With the foundation of the C2PA, technical standards will be unified while these two entities continue to pursue adoption, prototyping and education within their respective communities.

Today's C2PA announcement builds on several recent advances in content provenance, including [Project Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W3Om9Xbj2k&feature=youtu.be)'s efforts to develop a pipeline for signaling, certification and tracking the history of news content; the [CAI](https://contentauthenticity.org/case-study)'s first-ever end-to-end demonstration of provenance for captured media online; and [Truepic](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/truepic-breakthrough-charts-a-path-for-restoring-trust-in-photos-and-videos-at-internet-scale-301152998.html?tc=eml_cleartime)'s development of the first native integration of hardware-secured photo capture smartphone technology.

Designing standards and technologies that can certify the source and provenance of online content is an important step forward in addressing rising concerns with the manipulation and manufacture of news and information.
